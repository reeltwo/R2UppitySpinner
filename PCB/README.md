The files were created using Fusion 360, which uses a new version of the Eagle format.

- LifterPCB.brd
- LifterPCB.sch

- RotaryPCB.brd
- RotaryPCB.sch

These files were exported in Eagle v9 compatible format.

- LifterPCB_v9.brd
- LifterPBC_v9.sch

- RotaryPCB_v9.brd
- RotaryPCB_v9.sch

This version uses thicker traces and adds a copper pour. The lifter board is a four layer board. The order of the connection pins on the rotary has changed. Do NOT use the same cable as the older board. The order was changed to allow using a silicone ribbon cable and this crimp connector:

If you do not plan on using the ribbon cable there is no need to switch to this version of the lifter.
